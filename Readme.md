# Autoscaling and Load Balancing a Web Application
## Overview
Load balancing in cloud computing is the process in which workloads and computing resources are distributed across more than one servers. The workload is divided among two or more servers, network interfaces, hard drives and other computing resources which result in better utilization and system response time. While auto-scaling is a way to automatically scale up or down the number of compute resources that are being allocated to your application based on its needs at any given time.

There are number of ways to autoscale and load balance your applications using wide range of tools available. In this example, We'll demonstrate auto scaling and load balancing of a Web API using nothing but open source tools. 

Basic architecture of the implementation looks like this:
